Universal or Global Python Class Factory

The replaces an older library - that has long since gone to dust. This library will be kept with support for the current
production versions of python. 

At its core, this library is rather simple. It is a registry of all classes either manually added or automatically discovered 
from a given python module. All the classes can then be dynamically generated - a factory without having to build a factory!
