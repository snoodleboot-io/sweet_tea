# Experiment Tracking Setup

## Overview
Track ML experiments to understand what works, compare approaches, and reproduce results.

## Experiment Tracking Systems

### MLflow
- Lightweight Python library
- Log parameters, metrics, artifacts
- Built-in UI for comparison
- Model registry included
- Backend-agnostic

### Weights & Biases
- Cloud-based tracking
- Rich visualizations
- Collaboration features
- API-first design
- Integration with many frameworks

### Neptune
- MLOps platform
- Real-time monitoring
- Team collaboration
- Metadata tracking
- Scalable infrastructure

### Kubeflow
- Kubernetes-native
- Complex workflows
- Distributed training
- Production-ready
- Enterprise-grade

## What to Track

### Hyperparameters
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Regularization parameters
- Model architecture choices
- Optimizer settings

### Metrics
- Training loss/accuracy
- Validation metrics
- Test set performance
- Business metrics
- Execution time

### Artifacts
- Model checkpoints
- Training data samples
- Preprocessed data
- Plots and visualizations
- Config files

### Metadata
- Environment info
- Git commit hash
- Author/timestamp
- Notes and tags
- Dependencies/versions

## Experiment Structure

```yaml
experiment:
  name: "model_v2"
  description: "Testing new feature engineering"
  runs:
    - run_id: "abc123"
      parameters:
        learning_rate: 0.001
        batch_size: 32
      metrics:
        train_loss: 0.145
        val_accuracy: 0.92
      artifacts:
        - model.pkl
        - feature_importance.png
      status: complete
```

## Reproducibility

### Environment
- Docker images
- Requirements files
- Python version
- Library versions
- Hardware specs

### Random Seeds
- Set seed at start
- Document seed values
- Affects: data splitting, initialization, dropout
- Makes results reproducible

### Data Versioning
- Track data versions
- Know exactly which data was used
- Detect data changes
- Enable rollback

## Comparison & Analysis

### Parameter Importance
- Which parameters matter most
- Sensitivity analysis
- Interaction effects
- Optimization focus

### Learning Curves
- Training progress
- Convergence analysis
- Overfitting detection
- Early stopping decisions

### Error Analysis
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Error distribution
- Failure case analysis
- Improvement opportunities

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent naming:** Clear experiment names
2. **Document everything:** Why this experiment
3. **Track all parameters:** Even those you think don't matter
4. **Version everything:** Code, data, environment
5. **Regular cleanup:** Archive old experiments
6. **Team standards:** Consistent structure across team
7. **Integration:** Automate tracking in training code
