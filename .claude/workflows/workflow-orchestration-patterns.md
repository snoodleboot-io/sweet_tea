# Workflow Orchestration Patterns

## 1. Sequential Orchestration

Execute tasks one after another in strict order.

### Implementation:
```yaml
workflow:
  name: sequential_process
  steps:
    - name: step_1
      execute: task_a
      on_complete: proceed
    - name: step_2
      depends_on: step_1
      execute: task_b
      on_complete: proceed
    - name: step_3
      depends_on: step_2
      execute: task_c
```

### Use Cases:
- Data validation → processing → storage
- Build → test → deploy pipelines
- Approval workflows with multiple stages

### Advantages:
- Deterministic execution order
- Easy to debug
- Clear dependencies

### Disadvantages:
- Slower than parallel execution
- Blocks on slow tasks
- Less resource efficient

## 2. Parallel Orchestration

Execute independent tasks simultaneously.

### Implementation:
```yaml
workflow:
  name: parallel_process
  steps:
    - name: parallel_group
      type: parallel
      tasks:
        - task_a
        - task_b
        - task_c
      join_strategy: all
    - name: aggregation
      depends_on: parallel_group
      execute: combine_results
```

### Use Cases:
- Processing multiple data sources
- Running multiple analysis in parallel
- Concurrent system checks

### Advantages:
- Faster execution (N tasks in parallel time)
- Better resource utilization
- Scales with workload

### Disadvantages:
- Harder to debug
- Race conditions possible
- Resource contention

## 3. Conditional Orchestration

Branch execution based on conditions.

### Implementation:
```yaml
workflow:
  name: conditional_process
  steps:
    - name: check_condition
      execute: validate_input
      branches:
        - condition: valid
          next: process_data
        - condition: invalid
          next: handle_error
    - name: process_data
      execute: transform
    - name: handle_error
      execute: report_error
```

### Use Cases:
- Different processing based on data type
- Retry logic with backoff
- Feature flags and A/B testing

---

## 4. Fan-Out / Fan-In Pattern

Distribute work to many workers, then aggregate.

### Implementation:
```yaml
workflow:
  name: fan_out_fan_in
  steps:
    - name: fan_out
      type: parallel
      for_each: items
      execute: process_item
      fan_out_count: 10
    - name: fan_in
      type: aggregate
      depends_on: fan_out
      strategy: merge_results
```

### Use Cases:
- Batch data processing
- Distributed ML training
- Map-reduce operations

---

## 5. Compensation Pattern (Saga)

Execute forward steps with rollback capability.

### Implementation:
```yaml
workflow:
  name: compensation_workflow
  steps:
    - name: step_1
      execute: reserve_resource
      compensate: release_resource
    - name: step_2
      execute: allocate_quota
      compensate: deallocate_quota
    - name: step_3
      execute: confirm_transaction
      on_error: trigger_compensations
```

### Use Cases:
- Distributed transactions
- Long-running sagas
- Financial operations

## Best Practices

1. **Choose pattern based on dependencies:**
   - Sequential: Linear dependencies
   - Parallel: Independent tasks
   - Conditional: Decision points
   - Fan-out: Homogeneous bulk work

2. **Error handling:** Always define what happens on failure

3. **Monitoring:** Track workflow state and transitions

4. **Idempotency:** Make steps safe to retry

5. **Resource limits:** Define concurrency caps for fan-out
