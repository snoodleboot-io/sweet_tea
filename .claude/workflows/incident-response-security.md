### Phase 1: Preparation

**1.1 Incident Response Plan Development**
```yaml
incident_response_plan:
  team_structure:
    incident_commander: "CISO"
    technical_lead: "Security Engineer"
    communications_lead: "PR Manager"
    legal_advisor: "General Counsel"
    forensics_lead: "Sr. Security Analyst"
    
  contact_list:
    internal:
      - name: "On-call Security"
        phone: "+1-555-0100"
        email: "security@company.com"
    external:
      - name: "FBI Cyber Division"
        phone: "+1-555-FBI-CYBER"
      - name: "Incident Response Retainer"
        phone: "+1-555-IR-HELP"
    
  severity_levels:
    critical:
      description: "Data breach, ransomware, service outage"
      response_time: "15 minutes"
      escalation: "Immediate C-suite notification"
    high:
      description: "System compromise, targeted attack"
      response_time: "1 hour"
      escalation: "CISO notification"

    low:
      description: "Policy violation, false positive"
      response_time: "24 hours"
      escalation: "Security analyst"
```

**1.2 Playbook Development**
```python
playbooks = {
    "ransomware": {
        "detection": ["Encryption activity", "Ransom note", "File extensions changed"],
        "containment": ["Isolate affected systems", "Disable accounts", "Block C2"],
        "eradication": ["Remove malware", "Patch vulnerabilities", "Reset credentials"],
        "recovery": ["Restore from backups", "Validate integrity", "Monitor for reinfection"]
    },
    "data_breach": {
        "detection": ["Unusual data transfer", "Unauthorized access", "Alert from partner"],
        "containment": ["Revoke access", "Reset passwords", "Enable MFA"],
        "investigation": ["Determine scope", "Identify data types", "Timeline analysis"],
        "notification": ["Legal review", "Regulatory filing", "Customer notification"]
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Detection and Analysis

**2.1 Incident Detection Sources**
```python
detection_sources = [
    {"source": "SIEM Alerts", "reliability": "High", "automation": "Full"},
    {"source": "IDS/IPS", "reliability": "Medium", "automation": "Full"},
    {"source": "Endpoint Detection", "reliability": "High", "automation": "Full"},
    {"source": "User Reports", "reliability": "Low", "automation": "None"},
    {"source": "Threat Intelligence", "reliability": "Medium", "automation": "Partial"},
    {"source": "External Notification", "reliability": "Variable", "automation": "None"}
]
```

**2.2 Initial Triage Process**
```python
def triage_incident(alert):
    triage_checklist = {
        "is_false_positive": check_known_false_positives(alert),
        "affected_systems": identify_affected_systems(alert),
        "data_sensitivity": classify_data_involved(alert),
        "attack_vector": determine_attack_vector(alert),
        "threat_actor": identify_threat_actor_ttp(alert),
        "business_impact": assess_business_impact(alert)
    }
    
    severity = calculate_severity(triage_checklist)
    return {
        "incident_id": generate_incident_id(),
        "severity": severity,
        "checklist": triage_checklist,
        "next_steps": determine_response_actions(severity)
    }
```

**2.3 Evidence Collection**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Forensic evidence collection script

INCIDENT_ID="INC-2024-0412"
EVIDENCE_DIR="/forensics/${INCIDENT_ID}"

# Create evidence directory
mkdir -p ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/{memory,disk,network,logs}

# Capture memory dump
sudo ./lime.ko -o ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/memory/memory.dump

# Capture network connections
netstat -antp > ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/network/connections.txt
lsof -i > ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/network/open_ports.txt

# Capture process list
ps auxf > ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/memory/processes.txt
top -b -n 1 > ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/memory/top_snapshot.txt

# Capture system logs
tar czf ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/logs/system_logs.tar.gz /var/log/

# Create disk image
dd if=/dev/sda of=${EVIDENCE_DIR}/disk/disk.img bs=4M

# Calculate hashes for chain of custody
find ${EVIDENCE_DIR} -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > ${EVIDENCE_DIR}/evidence_hashes.txt
```

### Phase 3: Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

**3.1 Containment Strategies**
```python
class ContainmentActions:
    def __init__(self, incident):
        self.incident = incident
        self.actions_taken = []
    
    def network_isolation(self, system_id):
        """Isolate system from network"""
        commands = [
            f"sudo iptables -I INPUT -s {system_id} -j DROP",
            f"sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -d {system_id} -j DROP",
            f"vlan isolate {system_id} quarantine"
        ]
        self.execute_commands(commands)
        self.actions_taken.append(f"Network isolation: {system_id}")
    
    def disable_accounts(self, compromised_users):
        """Disable compromised accounts"""
        for user in compromised_users:
            ad_disable(user)
            revoke_tokens(user)
            force_password_reset(user)
            self.actions_taken.append(f"Disabled account: {user}")
    
    def block_indicators(self, iocs):
        """Block malicious indicators"""
        for ioc in iocs:
            if ioc.type == "ip":
                firewall_block(ioc.value)
            elif ioc.type == "domain":
                dns_sinkhole(ioc.value)
            elif ioc.type == "hash":
                edr_block(ioc.value)
            self.actions_taken.append(f"Blocked {ioc.type}: {ioc.value}")
```

**3.2 Eradication Process**
```python
def eradicate_threat(incident):
    eradication_steps = []
    
    # Remove malware
    if incident.malware_present:
        for system in incident.affected_systems:
            scan_result = antivirus_scan(system)
            if scan_result.threats:
                quarantine_threats(scan_result.threats)
                eradication_steps.append(f"Removed {len(scan_result.threats)} threats from {system}")
    
    # Patch vulnerabilities
    vulnerabilities = identify_exploited_vulns(incident)
    for vuln in vulnerabilities:
        patch_status = apply_patch(vuln)
        eradication_steps.append(f"Patched {vuln.cve}: {patch_status}")
    
    # Reset credentials
    compromised_accounts = incident.compromised_accounts
    for account in compromised_accounts:
        reset_password(account)
        revoke_all_sessions(account)
        enable_mfa(account)
        eradication_steps.append(f"Reset credentials: {account}")
    
    return eradication_steps
```

**3.3 Recovery Operations**
```yaml
recovery_checklist:
  validation:
    - verify_malware_removed: true
    - verify_vulnerabilities_patched: true
    - verify_accounts_secured: true
    
  restoration:
    - restore_from_backup:
        backup_date: "2024-04-10"
        systems: ["web-server-01", "db-server-01"]
        validation: "checksum_verified"
    - rebuild_systems:
        systems: ["workstation-042"]
        image: "golden_image_v2.1"
    
  monitoring:
    - enhanced_monitoring_period: "30 days"
    - additional_logging: "enabled"
    - threat_hunting_scheduled: "daily"
    
  verification:
    - functionality_testing: "passed"
    - security_validation: "passed"
    - performance_baseline: "normal"
```

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity

**4.1 Lessons Learned Meeting**
```markdown
# Incident Post-Mortem: INC-2024-0412

## Timeline
- **T+0:00** - Initial alert from SIEM (SQL injection attempt)
- **T+0:15** - Triage completed, elevated to High severity
- **T+0:30** - Incident Response Team activated
- **T+1:00** - Containment actions initiated
- **T+2:30** - Threat actor expelled from environment
- **T+6:00** - Systems restored to operation
- **T+24:00** - Enhanced monitoring enabled

## What Went Well
- Rapid detection (15 minutes from compromise to alert)
- Effective containment prevented lateral movement
- Clear communication throughout incident

## What Needs Improvement
- Playbook for SQL injection was outdated
- Backup restoration took longer than RTO
- Legal notification process was unclear

## Action Items
1. Update SQL injection playbook - Due: 2024-04-20
2. Test backup restoration quarterly - Due: Q2 2024
3. Document legal notification workflow - Due: 2024-04-25
4. Implement automated containment for this attack pattern - Due: 2024-05-01
```

## Advanced Incident Response Scenarios

### Ransomware Response
```python
def ransomware_response(detection_alert):
    # Immediate containment
    affected_systems = identify_encryption_activity()
    for system in affected_systems:
        network_isolate(system)
        suspend_processes(system)
        capture_memory_dump(system)
    
    # Identify ransomware strain
    ransom_note = extract_ransom_note()
    malware_hash = calculate_file_hash()
    ransomware_family = identify_ransomware(ransom_note, malware_hash)
    
    # Check for decryptor
    if decryptor_available(ransomware_family):
        decrypt_files(decryptor_tool)
    else:
        # Restore from backups
        validate_backup_integrity()
        restore_from_backup()
    
    # Threat hunt for persistence
    hunt_for_backdoors()
    check_scheduled_tasks()
    analyze_registry_modifications()
```

### Supply Chain Attack Response
```python
def supply_chain_incident(vendor_notification):
    # Identify affected components
    affected_software = parse_vendor_notification(vendor_notification)
    our_systems = inventory_scan(affected_software)
    
    # Impact assessment
    for system in our_systems:
        data_processed = assess_data_exposure(system)
        downstream_systems = trace_connections(system)
        risk_score = calculate_supply_chain_risk(data_processed, downstream_systems)
    
    # Containment and remediation
    if risk_score == "critical":
        immediate_isolation(our_systems)
        vendor_patch = wait_for_vendor_patch()
        apply_patch(vendor_patch)
    else:
        implement_compensating_controls()
        monitor_closely(our_systems)
```
