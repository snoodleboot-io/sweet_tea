# Model Retraining Strategy

## Overview
Model performance degrades over time due to data drift. This workflow covers strategies for detecting and retraining models.

## Drift Detection

### Data Drift
- Monitor feature distributions
- Compare training vs production data
- Alert on significant changes
- Automated detection pipelines

### Label Drift
- Track actual vs predicted outcomes
- Monitor ground truth distribution
- Detect concept drift early
- Trigger retraining on threshold

### Performance Drift
- Monitor key metrics (accuracy, F1, AUC)
- Set alert thresholds
- Compare baseline vs current
- Automated performance tracking

## Retraining Triggers

### Scheduled Retraining
- Daily/weekly/monthly cycles
- Regardless of performance
- Ensures fresh data
- Predictable cost

### Drift-Based Retraining
- Triggered when drift detected
- Reactive to changes
- Variable costs
- Better accuracy maintenance

### Hybrid Approach
- Scheduled + drift triggers
- Minimum interval enforcement
- Maximum interval fallback
- Balanced approach

## Retraining Pipeline

### Data Selection
- Recent data vs historical
- Balanced class distribution
- Quality filtering
- Feature engineering

### Validation Strategy
- Holdout test set (not used in training)
- Cross-validation
- Time-based splits for time series
- Simulation of production conditions

### Model Comparison
- A/B test old vs new
- Statistical significance testing
- Business metric evaluation
- Rollback criteria

## Deployment Strategy

### Canary Deployment
- Roll out to 5% of traffic
- Monitor metrics
- Gradual increase
- Easy rollback

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Keep old model live
- Deploy new in parallel
- Switch when ready
- Instant rollback capability

### Shadow Mode
- New model runs but doesn't affect predictions
- Collect metrics
- Validate accuracy
- Then switch to live

## Cost Management

### Sampling
- Don't retrain on all data
- Statistically sound samples
- Reduce computation costs
- Maintain accuracy

### Model Compression
- Smaller models if possible
- Quantization
- Pruning
- Faster inference

## Monitoring

### Training Metrics
- Training loss/accuracy
- Validation metrics
- Training time
- Resource usage

### Production Metrics
- Inference latency
- Throughput
- Error rates
- Business metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Automate detection:** Manual drift detection is slow
2. **Set clear thresholds:** When to trigger retraining
3. **Validate rigorously:** New model must be better
4. **Rollback plan:** Always able to revert
5. **Monitor costs:** Retraining is expensive
6. **Version models:** Track which data/code created model
7. **Document changes:** Why was model retrained
