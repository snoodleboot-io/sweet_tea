## Steps

### 1. Define Business Objectives

**Goal:** Understand the business context and success criteria.

#### 1.1 Identify the Core Problem
What problem are we solving?

**Good problem statements:**
- "Customer support team spends 40% of time answering repetitive questions"
- "Users abandon checkout due to slow payment processing (8% cart abandonment)"
- "Manual data entry causes 15% error rate in financial reports"

**Bad problem statements (too vague):**
- "We need a better website"

### 3. Design System Architecture

**Goal:** Define the system's structure and components.

#### 3.1 Choose Architecture Pattern

**Monolith vs Microservices vs Serverless:**

**Monolith (recommended for MVP):**
```
Pros:
- Simple deployment (single artifact)
- Easy local development
- Faster initial development
- Easier debugging
- Lower infrastructure cost

Cons:
- Harder to scale specific components
- Longer deployment times as app grows
- Technology lock-in (one language/framework)

When to use:
- MVP or new product (unproven scale)
- Small team (<10 developers)
- Simple domain with few bounded contexts
```

**Microservices:**
```
Pros:
- Independent scaling per service
- Technology flexibility
- Team autonomy
- Fault isolation

Cons:
- Complex infrastructure
- Distributed system challenges
- Higher operational overhead
- Slower initial development

When to use:
- Proven product with clear bounded contexts
- Large team (>20 developers)
- Different scaling needs per component
- Need for technology diversity
```

**Serverless:**
```
Pros:
- Auto-scaling
- Pay per use
- No server management
- Fast time to market

Cons:
- Vendor lock-in
- Cold start latency
- Complex debugging
- Cost unpredictability at scale

When to use:
- Event-driven workloads
- Bursty traffic
- Small team, want low ops overhead
- Prototype or side project
```

**Decision for our example (Support Portal):**
```
Choice: Monolith (for MVP)
Rationale:
- Small team (3 devs)
- Unproven scale (starting with 50 users)
- Simple domain (CRUD + search)
- 3-month timeline (microservices too complex)
- Can refactor to microservices later if needed
```

#### 3.2 Define Component Architecture

**High-level architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Web Browser    │
│  (React SPA)    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ HTTPS
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Load Balancer  │
│  (ALB)          │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  API Server     │
│  (FastAPI)      │
│  - Auth         │
│  - Articles     │
│  - Tickets      │
│  - Search       │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┬──────────┐
    ▼         ▼          ▼
┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
│ Postgres│ │ Redis  │ │Elasticsearch│
│ (data)  │ │(cache) │ │  (search) │
└─────────┘ └────────┘ └─────────┘
```

**Component responsibilities:**

**Frontend (React):**
- User interface rendering
- Client-side routing
- Form validation
- API communication
- State management (Redux)

**Backend (FastAPI):**
- REST API endpoints
- Business logic
- Authentication/authorization
- Database operations
- Integration with external services

**Database (PostgreSQL):**
- User accounts
- Articles content
- Support tickets
- Audit logs

**Cache (Redis):**
- Session data
- Frequently accessed articles
- Search result caching
- Rate limiting counters

**Search (Elasticsearch):**
- Full-text article search
- Autocomplete suggestions
- Analytics aggregations

#### 3.3 Design Data Model

**Core entities:**

```sql
-- Users
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'admin', 'agent', 'user'
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);

-- Articles
CREATE TABLE articles (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    author_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    category VARCHAR(100),
    view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    published_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- Support Tickets
CREATE TABLE tickets (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    subject VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'open', 'in_progress', 'resolved'
    priority VARCHAR(50), -- 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent'
    assigned_to UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_category ON articles(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_articles_published ON articles(published_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_user ON tickets(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_status ON tickets(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_assigned ON tickets(assigned_to);
```

#### 3.4 Plan for Scalability

**Horizontal scaling strategy:**

```
Phase 1 (0-1K users):
- Single application server
- Single database instance
- No caching layer needed

Phase 2 (1K-10K users):
- 2-3 application servers behind load balancer
- Database read replica for reports/analytics
- Redis cache for sessions and hot data

Phase 3 (10K-100K users):
- Auto-scaling group (5-20 servers)
- Database sharding by customer ID
- CDN for static assets
- Elasticsearch cluster (3 nodes)
- Redis cluster (3 nodes)
```

**Caching strategy:**
```
Layer 1: CDN (CloudFront)
- Static assets (JS, CSS, images)
- TTL: 7 days

Layer 2: Redis (application cache)
- Article content (popular articles)
- Search results (recent queries)
- Session data
- TTL: 5 minutes to 1 hour

Layer 3: Database query cache
- PostgreSQL query result cache
- TTL: Managed by database
```

- Time: 2 days
- Outcome: Search results acceptable, proceed

**Spike 2: Real-time notifications**
- Goal: Test WebSocket scalability (1000 concurrent connections)
- Time: 1 day
- Outcome: Socket.io handles load, proceed

**Spike 3: Salesforce API integration**
- Goal: Test data sync reliability
- Time: 3 days
- Outcome: API rate limits stricter than expected, need caching

#### 6.3 Validate Assumptions
Test key assumptions:

**Assumption 1: PostgreSQL full-text search is good enough for MVP**
- Test: Index 10K articles, search with common queries
- Result: <100ms response time, relevance acceptable ✓

**Assumption 2: Fargate costs are within budget**
- Calculation: 2 tasks × 0.5 vCPU × 1GB × $0.04/hour × 730 hours = $29/month
- Result: Under $200/month infrastructure budget ✓

**Assumption 3: Team can deliver in 12 weeks**
- Review: Compared to past projects of similar scope
- Result: Realistic with reduced MVP scope ✓

#### 6.4 Get Approval and Commit

Build a web analytics platform for small businesses (competitor to Google Analytics but simpler).

**Users:**
- Year 1: 100 businesses (10K events/day)
- Year 3: 10K businesses (100M events/day)

**Success Criteria:**
- <50ms event ingestion
- Real-time dashboard updates
- $10/month pricing (must be profitable)

**Architecture Decision:**
```
Monolith rejected: Need to scale ingestion independently from dashboard
Microservices rejected: Too complex for small team
Serverless chosen: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use aligns with business model

Components:
- Event ingestion: AWS Lambda (handles spikes)
- Storage: DynamoDB (scalable, low latency)
- Analytics: Athena (query historical data)
- Dashboard: React + API Gateway + Lambda
```

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Python Lambda functions
- Frontend: React (hosted on S3 + CloudFront)
- Database: DynamoDB (events), RDS (customer data)
- Queue: SQS (event buffer)
- Analytics: Athena + S3 (data lake)

**Implementation Plan:**
```
Phase 1 (MVP): Event tracking + basic dashboard (8 weeks)
Phase 2: Advanced analytics (4 weeks)
Phase 3: Custom reports (4 weeks)
```

**Cost validation:**
```
Lambda: $0.20 per 1M requests
DynamoDB: $1.25/GB/month
S3: $0.023/GB/month
Estimated cost for 10K businesses: $500/month
Revenue: 10K × $10 = $100K/month
Margin: 99.5% ✓ Profitable
```

**Result:** Strategy approved, launched successfully in 4 months.
