# Maintenance Orchestration (Verbose)

## Purpose

The Maintenance Orchestration subagent coordinates 8 critical operational workflows that ensure your codebase remains production-ready, secure, performant, and maintainable over the long term. These workflows form the backbone of continuous operational excellence.

## The 8 Maintenance Workflows

### 1. Code Quality Maintenance Workflow

**When to Use:**
- Per-PR code review to enforce standards
- Weekly quality summary to track trends
- Before releases to ensure baseline quality

**What It Does:**
- Runs automated checks (ruff format, ruff check, pyright)
- Verifies all tests passing and coverage not decreased
- Ensures no hardcoded secrets or constants
- Checks code follows naming conventions and patterns
- Validates docstrings on public functions
- Reviews error handling patterns

**Frequency:** 
- Automated: Every commit via pre-commit hooks
- Manual: Every PR review by code reviewer
- Summary: Weekly code quality report

**Integration:**
- CI/CD: Runs as part of build pipeline
- Pre-commit: Automated formatting and linting
- PR Review: Manual checklist for complex logic

---

### 2. Coverage Improvement Workflow

**When to Use:**
- Weekly analysis of coverage gaps
- After implementing new features
- Quarterly deep-dive to plan improvements

**What It Does:**
- Identifies untested code paths
- Categorizes by: happy path, error handling, edge cases
- Prioritizes by: risk level, effort to test, strategic importance
- Tracks progress toward coverage goals
- Reports coverage trends

**Targets:**
- Overall: 85%+ (allows for edge cases)
- Per-class: 90%+ minimum
- Critical paths: 95%+ (user-facing, security, data)

**3-Week Action Plan:**
- Week 1: Critical files (UI, security)
- Week 2: Important modules (core logic)
- Week 3: Integration and edge cases

**Tracking Metrics:**
- Line coverage %
- Branch coverage %
- Coverage trend (increasing/stable/declining)
- Gap areas requiring work

---

### 3. Dependency Update Workflow

**When to Use:**
- Weekly check for outdated packages
- Monthly full upgrade cycle
- Immediately for critical security patches

**What It Does:**
- Scans for outdated dependencies
- Reviews breaking changes in major versions
- Runs full test suite after updates
- Security audit for known vulnerabilities
- Documents changes in commit message

**Process:**

**Weekly Check (15 minutes):**
```bash
uv pip list --outdated  # See what's out of date
pip-audit --desc        # Check for vulnerabilities
```

**Monthly Update (2 hours):**
1. Check outdated packages (5 min)
2. Update dependencies (10 min)
3. Run test suite (20 min)
4. Security audit (5 min)
5. Commit and verify in CI (10 min)

**Decision Tree:**
- Critical vulnerability found? → Update immediately
- Breaking change in major version? → Create PR for review
- Minor/patch update? → Apply and test

**Rollback Procedure:**
If update breaks code:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 uv.lock pyproject.toml
uv sync
pytest  # Verify tests pass again
git commit -m "chore(deps): Revert [package] due to breaking changes"
```

### 4. Metrics & Monitoring Workflow

**When to Use:**
- Weekly collection of health metrics
- Monthly trend analysis
- Quarterly strategic review

**What It Does:**
- Collects: test count, pass rate, coverage %, complexity, build time
- Tracks: trends over time, alerts on regressions
- Reports: weekly snapshots, monthly trends, quarterly forecasts
- Identifies: optimization opportunities, performance issues

**Key Metrics:**
- **Coverage:** Target 85%+, trend should be stable/increasing
- **Test Pass Rate:** Target 98%+, flag any failures immediately
- **Code Complexity:** Avg cyclomatic < 5, max < 15
- **Build Time:** Should be < 30 seconds for full suite
- **Dependency Age:** Most recent versions, no critical CVEs

**Monthly Report Template:**
```
Coverage: X% (was Y%, trend: ↑/→/↓)
Tests: N total (M passing, X failing/skipped)
Complexity: X avg (was Y, trend: ↑/→/↓)
Build Time: X sec (was Y sec, trend: ↑/→/↓)
Alerts: [Any metrics below target]
Actions: [What needs attention this month]
```

### 5. Performance Monitoring Workflow

**When to Use:**
- Weekly Thursday check for regressions
- Monthly trend analysis
- After major changes that might impact performance

**What It Does:**
- Measures test suite execution time
- Analyzes code complexity (cyclomatic, maintainability)
- Detects performance regressions
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Recommends optimizations

**Targets:**
- Test suite: < 25 seconds
- Avg complexity: < 5
- Maintainability index: > 80
- No functions > 50 lines (unless justified)

**Weekly Check:**
```bash
time pytest --cov -q          # Test duration
radon cc prompticorn/ -a    # Complexity analysis
radon mi prompticorn/       # Maintainability index
```

**Response Actions:**
- If slower than last week: Find slow tests, consider parallelization
- If complexity rising: Schedule refactoring
- If maintainability declining: Improve naming, reduce function length

## When to Escalate

Escalate immediately if:
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Test pass rate drops below 90%
- Any code with hardcoded secrets
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Release blocked by failing tests
- Dependency conflict blocking work

## Recommended Schedule

**Daily:**
- Pre-commit checks (automated, < 30 sec)

**Weekly:**
- Monday: Metrics collection
- Thursday: Performance monitoring
- Friday: Coverage analysis

**Monthly:**
- First Wednesday: Security audit
- First Monday: Dependency updates
- Second Thursday: Tech debt review
- Last Friday: Release cycle

**Quarterly:**
- Coverage deep-dive
- Performance optimization planning
- Security posture review
- Tech debt strategic cleanup

## Getting Started

1. **Start Small:** Begin with Code Quality (automated)
2. **Add Security:** Security audits (monthly)
3. **Track Metrics:** Weekly health check
4. **Expand Gradually:** Add other workflows as capacity allows
5. **Automate:** Move manual workflows to CI/CD pipeline

Remember: Maintenance workflows are **not overhead** - they are **investments in sustainability**. Every hour spent on maintenance saves 10x the effort in firefighting later.
