# Subagent - Architect Data Model (Verbose)

Comprehensive guidance for designing data models and database schemas.

---

## Overview

When the user asks to design a data model, schema, or database structure, follow this process to ensure you gather requirements, design a robust schema, and identify potential issues before implementation.

---

## Step 1: Gather Requirements

**Purpose:** Understand the domain before designing tables.

Before producing any schema design, ask these questions:

### Core Questions

1. **What are the core entities and their relationships?**
   - Identify nouns in the requirements (User, Order, Product)
   - Map relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
   - Identify entities vs attributes (is Address an entity or just fields on User?)

2. **What are the most common read patterns?**
   - Which queries will run frequently?
   - What joins will be needed?
   - Are there aggregations or analytics queries?
   - Example: "List all orders for a user" vs "Count orders by status"

3. **What are the most common write patterns?**
   - What gets inserted/updated frequently?
   - Are there bulk operations?
   - Are writes append-only or update-heavy?
   - Example: "Insert 1000 events per second" vs "Update user profile once per day"

4. **Are there soft-delete, audit trail, or versioning requirements?**
   - Soft delete: `deleted_at` timestamp instead of hard delete
   - Audit trail: Track who changed what and when (`created_by`, `updated_by`)
   - Versioning: Keep history of changes (separate history table or JSONB field)

5. **Any known scale constraints?**
   - How many rows expected? (100, 1M, 1B)
   - Request volume? (10 req/sec, 10k req/sec)
   - Geographic distribution? (single region, multi-region)
   - Growth rate? (static, growing 2x per year)

**Why this matters:** Schema changes are expensive once data exists. Get it right early.

---

## Step 2: Produce Schema Design

**Purpose:** Create a complete, reviewable schema design.

After gathering requirements, produce the following deliverables:

### 2.1 Entity Definitions

For each entity, specify:
- **Name:** Table name (use snake_case)
- **Fields:** Column names and types
- **Nullability:** Which fields can be NULL?
- **Defaults:** Default values for fields
- **Constraints:** Primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints

**Example:**
```
Entity: users
- id: uuid, primary key, default gen_random_uuid()
- email: varchar(255), not null, unique
- password_hash: varchar(255), not null
- created_at: timestamp, not null, default now()
- updated_at: timestamp, not null, default now()
- deleted_at: timestamp, nullable (soft delete)

Constraints:
- PRIMARY KEY (id)
- UNIQUE (email)
- CHECK (email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$')
```

### 2.2 Relationship Diagram (Mermaid ERD)

Create a visual representation using Mermaid ERD syntax:

```
erDiagram
    USER {
        uuid id PK
        string email
        string password_hash
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
        timestamp deleted_at
    }
    ORDER {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string status
        decimal total_amount
        timestamp created_at
    }
    ORDER_ITEM {
        uuid id PK
        uuid order_id FK
        uuid product_id FK
        int quantity
        decimal price
    }
    PRODUCT {
        uuid id PK
        string name
        decimal price
        int stock_count
    }
    
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : "places"
    ORDER ||--o{ ORDER_ITEM : "contains"
    PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDER_ITEM : "referenced_by"
```

**Relationship notation:**
- `||--o{` = one-to-many (one user places many orders)
- `||--||` = one-to-one
- `}o--o{` = many-to-many (requires join table)

### 2.3 Index Recommendations

Based on the stated query patterns, recommend indexes:

**Example:**
```
Indexes:
- users.email (unique, btree) — login queries
- orders.user_id (btree) — "list orders for user" query
- orders.created_at (btree) — time-based queries, analytics
- orders.status (btree) — "count orders by status"
- order_items.order_id (btree) — FK lookup
- order_items.product_id (btree) — FK lookup

Composite indexes:
- (user_id, created_at) — "recent orders for user"
- (status, created_at) — "pending orders by date"
```

**Why composite indexes?**
- Order matters: `(user_id, created_at)` works for queries filtering by user_id, or both
- Does NOT work for queries filtering only by created_at
- Use for common multi-column WHERE/ORDER BY patterns

### 2.4 Denormalization or Caching Recommendations

Identify where normalization may hurt performance:

**Example:**
```
Denormalization opportunities:
1. Add `order_count` to users table
   - Rationale: Frequently queried, slow to compute on large tables
   - Tradeoff: Must update on every order insert/delete
   - Recommendation: Use materialized view or trigger

2. Store `product_name` in order_items
   - Rationale: Product name may change, but historical orders should preserve it
   - Tradeoff: Duplicate data
   - Recommendation: Denormalize for audit trail

Caching opportunities:
- Cache "active products" in Redis (TTL 5 min)
- Cache "user profile" in Redis (invalidate on update)
```

**When to denormalize:**
- ✅ Frequent read-heavy queries
- ✅ Expensive joins or aggregations
- ✅ Historical data that shouldn't change
- ❌ Avoid if writes are common (creates update anomalies)

### 2.5 Migration File Skeleton

Provide up/down migration structure:

**Example:**
```sql
-- Migration: 001_create_users_and_orders.sql
-- Up
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_created_at ON orders(created_at);

-- Down
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
```

**Migration best practices:**
- Always include `-- Up` and `-- Down` sections
- Add `IF EXISTS` or `IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency
- Use transactions where supported
- Test rollback before deploying

### 2.6 Open Questions and Tradeoffs

Flag decisions that need input before implementing:

**Example:**
```
Open Questions:
1. Should we use soft delete or hard delete for users?
   - Soft delete: Preserves data, complicates queries (must filter deleted_at IS NULL)
   - Hard delete: Simpler queries, but data loss

2. Should product price be duplicated in order_items?
   - Yes: Preserves historical price (recommended for e-commerce)
   - No: Saves space, but price changes affect old orders

3. How to handle currency?
   - Single currency: Store as DECIMAL
   - Multi-currency: Add currency_code field + conversion logic

Tradeoffs:
- Using UUIDs: More storage, but globally unique and harder to enumerate
- Using BIGINT: Less storage, but sequential IDs leak info (order count)
```

## Step 3: Design Only - No Code

**Purpose:** Get schema approved before writing ORM code.

Rules:
- ❌ Do NOT generate ORM models (SQLAlchemy, Prisma, etc.) yet
- ❌ Do NOT write application code that uses the schema
- ✅ Provide schema design only (DDL, ERD, indexes, recommendations)
- ✅ Wait for user approval before proceeding to implementation

**Why?** Schema changes are expensive. Get buy-in on design first.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Skipping the questions phase
```
User: "Design a schema for users and orders"
Assistant: [immediately generates tables without asking about requirements]
```
**Problem:** Missing context leads to wrong design.

### ✅ Correct:
```
User: "Design a schema for users and orders"
Assistant: "Before I design the schema, I need to understand:
1. What are the core entities? Just users and orders, or also products?
2. What are common read patterns? List orders by user? Filter by status?
3. ..."
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Missing indexes
```
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)
);
-- No index on user_id!
```
**Problem:** Queries like `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?` will be slow.

### ✅ Correct:
```
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Wrong relationship cardinality
```
erDiagram
    USER ||--|| ORDER : "places"
```
**Problem:** This says "one user places ONE order" (one-to-one). Wrong!

### ✅ Correct:
```
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : "places"
```
(One user places MANY orders)

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not considering soft delete
```
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?;
```
**Problem:** Hard delete loses data. Can't recover, can't audit.

### ✅ Correct:
```
UPDATE users SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE id = ?;
-- Then filter: WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: Generating ORM code too early
```
# SQLAlchemy model
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True)
    ...
```
**Problem:** Schema not approved yet. May need to rewrite.

### ✅ Correct:
- Show DDL (CREATE TABLE) first
- Get approval
- THEN generate ORM code

## Database Selection

Use the database specified in **Core Conventions**.

Common databases:
- **PostgreSQL:** Full-featured, JSON support, mature
- **MySQL:** Widely supported, good for read-heavy
- **SQLite:** Embedded, good for local dev
- **DynamoDB:** NoSQL, serverless, key-value

**If not specified, ask the user.**

---

## Example Workflow

**User:** "Design a schema for a blog with users, posts, and comments."

**Assistant:**

"Before I design the schema, I need to understand a few things:

1. **Entities:** Are there tags, categories, or media (images) as well?
2. **Read patterns:** Common queries - list posts by author? List comments by post?
3. **Write patterns:** How often are posts created vs updated?
4. **Features:** Do you need soft delete? Audit trail? Post versioning?
5. **Scale:** Expected number of users, posts, comments?

Once I have this info, I'll provide:
- Entity definitions
- ERD diagram
- Index recommendations
- Migration file

Please answer the questions above."

---

## Summary

**Process:**
1. Ask requirements questions
2. Produce schema design (entities, ERD, indexes, migrations)
3. Schema only - no ORM code until approved

**Deliverables:**
- Entity definitions with fields, types, constraints
- Mermaid ERD diagram
- Index recommendations
- Denormalization/caching suggestions
- Migration skeleton
- Open questions

**Key Rule:** Design first, code later.
