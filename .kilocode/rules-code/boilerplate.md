# Subagent - Code Boilerplate

Behavior when the user asks to generate boilerplate or structural code.

When the user asks to generate boilerplate, scaffolding, or structural code
(components, routes, services, models, repositories, hooks, middleware, etc.):

1. Before generating, read an existing file from the same layer of the codebase
   to understand the established pattern. Do not invent a new pattern.

2. Generate structure and signatures only — do not implement business logic.
   Use "// TODO: implement" placeholders where logic needs to be filled in.

3. All generated code must:
   - Follow Core Conventions exactly for naming and structure
   - Include typed interfaces and signatures — no any or unknown without narrowing
   - Include a test file skeleton alongside the implementation

4. Ask the user for the following if not provided:
   - Type (component, route, service, model, repository, hook, middleware)
   - Name (PascalCase)
   - Purpose (one sentence)

5. Do not implement logic — structure and signatures only.
