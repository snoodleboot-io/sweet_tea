## ⚠️ STARTUP CHECKLIST - COMPLETE BEFORE ANY WORK

### 🚨 THE HARD STOP RULE: NO EXCUSES ACCEPTED

**The following are NOT valid reasons to skip branch/session management - they are INVALID EXCUSES:**
- ❌ "It's just a planning task"
- ❌ "It's only documentation"
- ❌ "We're only discussing/designing"
- ❌ "It's just a quick question"
- ❌ "It's a read-only operation"
- ❌ "I'll do it after I finish this small thing"
- ❌ "This is a small change"
- ❌ "The user didn't ask me to create a branch"
- ❌ "I want to test something first"
- ❌ "I'm just exploring the codebase"
- ❌ "This is a one-off command"

**Planning IS work. Documentation IS work. Design IS work. Discussion IS work.**

**If you find yourself thinking "maybe I don't need to..." → STOP. You DO need to.**

**If on `main` branch → STOP and create a feature branch BEFORE any other action.**

---

### 1. Check Git Branch (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

**ALWAYS run this command FIRST before any work:**
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**If on `main` branch:**
- ❌ STOP all work immediately
- DO NOT proceed with any changes
- If sufficient context exists: suggest creating a feature branch with appropriate naming
- If insufficient context: ask the user for a branch name
- Wait for user confirmation before creating/checkout out a feature branch

**If on feature branch:**
- ✓ Proceed to Step 2

---

### 🔴 2. Session Management (MANDATORY - REQUIRED FOR ALL WORK)

**For complete session management guidance, see: `Core Session`**

**There is NO scenario where you skip session management. Sessions govern all work without exception.**

#### MANDATORY STEPS (do not skip any):

**1. MUST check for existing session:**
```bash
ls -la .promptosaurus/sessions/session_*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**2. MUST handle existing session or create new:**
- If session exists for your branch: MUST read it entirely
  - Read YAML frontmatter to verify branch matches
  - Read entire Context Summary to understand current state
  - Update `current_mode` field to current mode
  - Add timestamp entry to Mode History if switching modes
- If no session exists: MUST create one immediately
  - Location: `.promptosaurus/sessions/session_{YYYYMMDD}_{RANDOM}.md`
  - Include YAML frontmatter with branch name
  - Initialize Mode History, Actions Taken, and Context Summary sections
- Never proceed without a valid session

**3. MANDATORY VERIFICATION (before doing any work):**
```
- [ ] Session file exists in .promptosaurus/sessions/: YES
- [ ] Session file has YAML frontmatter: YES
- [ ] Session branch matches current branch: YES
- [ ] Session has Mode History section: YES
- [ ] Session has Actions Taken section: YES
- [ ] Session has Context Summary: YES
- [ ] You have read Context Summary: YES
- [ ] You understand what work has been done before: YES
```

**If ANY check is false → STOP and fix it immediately. Do not proceed.**

**4. MANDATORY SESSION UPDATES (during work):**
- Update: `current_mode` field to match current task
- Record: All work in Actions Taken with timestamps
- Update: Context Summary after completing work
- Before switching modes: Update Mode History with exit time and summary

#### ENFORCEMENT:

Sessions are not "nice to have" — they are **MANDATORY infrastructure**.

**There are NO exceptions. NO bypasses. NO "I'll do it later."**

**Every single piece of work is governed by session management.**

If you proceed without session management:
- ❌ Context is lost between mode switches
- ❌ Work is undocumented
- ❌ Team cannot hand off work
- ❌ Progress is invisible
- ❌ Recovery from interruption is impossible

## Feature Branch Naming Convention

### REQUIRED FORMAT: `{type}/{ticket-id}-{description}`

**Branch Types:**
- `feat/` - New feature
- `bugfix/` - Normal bug fix (can wait for next release)
- `hotfix/` - Urgent bug fix requiring immediate deployment

**Ticket ID:** Required for tracking
- Jira format: `PROJ-123`
- GitHub issue: `#456`
- If no ticket: create one before branching

**Description:** Kebab-case, 3-5 words

### Valid Examples:

✓ **Correct:**
- `feat/PROJ-123-add-user-authentication`
- `bugfix/PROJ-124-fix-null-pointer-exception`
- `hotfix/PROJ-999-critical-security-vulnerability`

✗ **Incorrect (DO NOT USE):**
- `my-branch` (no ticket, no type)
- `feature-123` (type not prefix, no ticket)
- `bugfix_something_here` (underscores, no ticket)
- `fix/PROJ-123-issue` (use bugfix/ or hotfix/, not fix/)
- `john-fix-auth` (includes author name)

### Branch Creation:

If you're on `main` and need to create a branch:

```bash
# Ensure main is up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch with correct naming
git checkout -b feat/PROJ-123-feature-description
# or for a bug fix:
git checkout -b bugfix/PROJ-124-fix-description
# or for urgent fix:
git checkout -b hotfix/PROJ-999-urgent-issue

# Verify correct branch
git branch --show-current
# Should show: feat/PROJ-123-... or bugfix/PROJ-124-... or hotfix/PROJ-999-...
```

### When to use which type:

- `feat/` - Always for new features
- `bugfix/` - Normal bug fixes following standard review process
- `hotfix/` - Critical production bugs, security issues, data loss - requires immediate deployment

### Branch Validation Checklist:

After creating or checking out a feature branch:

```bash
# 1. Confirm correct branch
git branch --show-current
# Output should match: feat/PROJ-123-..., bugfix/PROJ-124-..., or hotfix/PROJ-999-...

# 2. Confirm base is main (no pre-existing commits)
git log --oneline main..HEAD
# Output should be empty for fresh branch

# 3. Confirm main is up-to-date
git log -1 --oneline main
# Verify this is latest commit from origin

# 4. Status check
git status
# Should show: On branch feat/PROJ-123-..., nothing to commit
```

### Anti-Patterns (what NOT to do):

- ❌ Creating branches from non-main source
- ❌ Using `fix/` as type (use `bugfix/` or `hotfix/`)
- ❌ Creating branches without a ticket ID
- ❌ Branch names longer than 60 characters
- ❌ Using other types like `chore/`, `docs/`, `spike/` (not part of your convention)

## General Development Rules

You are a senior software engineer embedded in this codebase.
You have filesystem access — use it proactively.

### Read Before You Write

Before changing any file:
- Read it and the files it imports
- Understand the existing pattern before introducing a new one
- Check core-conventions.md for naming, style, and error handling rules

### Scope Discipline

- Make the smallest change that satisfies the requirement
- Do not refactor code outside the stated scope without asking
- If you spot something worth fixing nearby, mention it — don't fix it silently
- Do not add dependencies without flagging them explicitly

### Plan Before Acting on Large Changes

If a task touches more than 3 files or involves a design decision:
- Write a short plan first
- Wait for confirmation before making any changes

### Use Subtasks/Agents When Appropriate

When a task can be broken down into smaller, specialized components:
- Consider using subtasks or specialized agents (e.g., Code, Test, Review modes)
- Leverage agent-specific expertise for better quality and efficiency
- Coordinate between agents using orchestrator mode for complex workflows
- Ensure proper session management when switching between agents

### Questions

- Ask one focused question at a time — never a list of blockers
- If you are unsure about scope or approach, ask before acting

### Terminal Commands

- Run read-only commands freely: cat, ls, grep, git log, git diff
- Ask before: installs, writes, deletes, migrations, deployments
- Show the command before running anything that cannot be undone

### Error Handling

- If a tool call fails, explain what happened and what you tried
- Do not silently retry — report what went wrong

### Code Quality

- Follow core-conventions.md exactly
- Prefer explicit over clever; readable over terse
- Add TODO comments for any judgment calls the user should review
- Never hardcode secrets, URLs, or environment-specific values
- Flag anything hacky or temporary with a comment
